        <h3>Entertainment:</h3>
        Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, 
        <br>
        snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club,
        <br>
        seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Sightseeing:</h3>
        Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.

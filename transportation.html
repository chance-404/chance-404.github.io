        <h3>Getting to Tahini:</h3>
        Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.
        <br>
        <br>
        Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. 
        <br>
        Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Getting around the Island:</h3>
        Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law).
        <br>
        <br>
        Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable.
        <br>
        Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
